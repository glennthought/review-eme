                The placing of one loop inside the body of another loop is called?
                <p>
                    Nesting
                </p>

                It repeatedly loops until a
                particular condition is satisfied.
                <p>While loop/while</p>
                How many types of loops are there in Java?
                <p>2/3(diko alam HAHAHA</p>

                It is similar to the while loop statement,
                but the condition is below the operation.
                <p>Do-While</p>

                In a for-loop, this expression is typically
                located in the third section of the loop syntax
                <p>Iteration</p>
                It works like a break, but instead of forcing
                termination, it forces the next iteration of the
                loop to take place and
                skipping the rest of the code.
                <p>Continue Statement</p>
                A statement that once encountered automatic
                terminated the flow.
                <p>break statement</p>

                It is an endless or continuous loop
                <p>Infinite loop</p>

                It is used when the number of iterations is known
                beforehand. It iterates until a condition evaluates
                to false.
                <p>For Loop</p>
                It is executed once, as the loop begins
                <p>Initialization</p>

                It represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified
                <p>Object</p>
                What constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects?
                <p>Parameterized</p>

                Creating an object also refers to what?
                <p>Instantiating</p>

                It is a Java technique in which a class can have any number of constructors that differ in parameter lists
                <p>Constructor overloading</p>
                How many main method should be on a java file?
                <p>One</p>

                It is a class that has no fields and no methods
                <p>Barebone</p>

                What is the operator for creating a new Object?
                <p>new</p>

                It is also called the state or attributes of a class.

                <p>Fields</p>

                It is a special kind of method that has a parameters with it.

                <p>Constructor</p>

                It is a collection of fields and methods that operate on that data.

                Access specifiers can be optional.

                <p>True</p>
                The implementation defines how the method performs its tasks, including any computations, data manipulations, or interactions with other methods or properties.
                <p>True</p>

                Overloaded methods are methods with the same name but different method parameter lists.

                It is created by using double-quotes.
                <p>String</p>
                This method compares the given String with the current String
                <p>Compare to()</p>

                This method returns the count of the total number of characters present in the String.
                <p>length()</p>

                It refers to the collection of Strings that are stored in heap memory.
                <p>String pool</p>

                This method checks whether the String contains anything or not. If the java String is Empty, it returns true else false.
                <p>isEmpty()</p>

                This method  returns a string, replacing all the old characters or CharSequence with new characters.
                <p>Replaceto()</p>
                This method combines a specific string at the end of another string and ultimately returns a combined string.

                Each item in an array is called element.
                <p>True</p>

                String is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
                <p>False</p>


                The length method is used to find out how many indices already have elements in the ArrayList.
